Another version of my personal website.  This time based on the [Astro Framework](https://astro.build/).

I started by adopting an existing template but quickly discovered it wasn't the best fit for me.  However it did teach me enough about Astro to create my own template.

I like Astro.  It gives me the modern tools, but still allows me to generate a static site.
