## Description

My client has multiple remote sites that each need routine safety inspections to be completed.  The safety process is similar but varies a little for each site based on the capabilities of the site.  Through normal project requirements gathering we determined there were multiple authorization roles needed.  The system we generated utilizes granular access controls and allows the safety forms to be created, modified, and assigned to specific sites.  Site staff by default then can only access the forms for their site(s).  The Safety Officer then collects this data in the central office for later processing and reporting.

This system has been in constant use for many years now with almost no maintenance required. It is noted and commented on positively at the annual safety audits.

## Role

I handled all aspects of this project. Stakeholder meetings were held to identify requirements, and the system was designed to accommodate the needs of the project. I worked within the allocated budget to bring the project to production.  The system has been used reliably for many years with little maintenance required.
