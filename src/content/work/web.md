## Description

Over time I have worked on many business websites and applications covering everything from brochure type sites to interactive marketing campaigns.  The customers ranged from small organization up to and including fortune 500 companies with common name brand items.  My solutions always covered the full stack, including server management and database design when needed.

## Role

My roles in these projects ranged from team member to team leader and project manager.
